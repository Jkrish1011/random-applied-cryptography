# EdDSA implementation in Rust ðŸ¦€

This project showcases the implementation of a simplified digital signature scheme utilizing the EdDSA (Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm) in the Rust programming language.

The implementation will concentrate on the essential functionalities that constitute a digital signature scheme:
1. The generation of cryptographic keys
2. The process of signing a message using a private key
3. The verification of the signature's authenticity 

#### Why EdDSA?

The efficiency of algorithms like EdDSA can contribute to faster transaction processing and potentially lower transaction fees within blockchain networks.
